## Getting Started:
As an open source project we encourage a diverse set of backgrounds. As such, it is anticipated that you may not be familiar with all the recources we utalize. If you require help getting set up, please do not hesitate to ask!

###  1) Accounts:
- *Repository:*  [GitHub](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample)
- *To-do list:*  [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/V94BBx1d/4550ff50fe61eb27b8d304da57b00fe8/optimus-bind) (Click to join)
- *Chat room:*  [Slack](https://bioscienceclub.slack.com/messages/CHK7D10MN/details/) (Upon request)

### 2) Environment and Installs:
- Refer to [README.md](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample#installing)

### 3) Workflow: GitFlow 
If you are new to GitFlow, just think of it as a naming convention for branches. Doing so helps to organize the development, release, and maintenance of the repo.

Extensions currently maintained at: [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

<details>
<summary>Reasoning:</summary>

- Explicit/extensive workflow yields consistent practice & organized contributions  
- Highly segmented developement lends itself to well organized feature branches
- Not dependant upon the rapid development of continuous integration
</details>

### 4) On using git:
<details>
<summary><i>Git-Beginner (GUI):</i></summary>

If you have no git/gitflow experience and just want to get to work:
-   Sourcetree
-   Github Desktop

As a beginner, there is no need to concern yourself with the specifics of GitFlow. 
Just fork/clone, branch, commit, push and pull features with proper nameing conventions.

Fork here:

<details>
<summary><i>Git-Intermediate (Extensions):</i></summary>


Join as a contributor or [fork](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample/fork).
If you are familiar with git, but new to GitFlow, these extensions may help:
-   [GitFlow avh cheat sheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

Otherwise,
If contributor:
```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b [feature, hotfix]/your-branch-name
# work happens on branch
Push branch
Then make pull request
```

If forked:
```
git checkout develop
# work happens on branch
Request that we open a branch for you to merge into.
```
