# Contributing
We appreciate your consideration in supporting the development of Optimus Bind. The repository is well underway with a defined program outline, If you wish to contribute now is a great time to get involved!

## State of Development:
The current state of development and full listing of tasks can always be viewed at [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/V94BBx1d/4550ff50fe61eb27b8d304da57b00fe8/optimus-bind). Please coordinate with us on slack if you wish to contribute.

## Getting Started:
As an open source project we encourage a diverse set of backgrounds. As such, it is anticipated that you may not be familiar with all the recources we utalize. If you require help getting set up, please do not hesitate to ask!

###  1) Accounts:
- *Repository:*  [GitHub](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample)
- *To-do list:*  [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/V94BBx1d/4550ff50fe61eb27b8d304da57b00fe8/optimus-bind) (Click to join)
- *Chat room:*  [Slack](https://bioscienceclub.slack.com/messages/CHK7D10MN/details/) (Upon request)

### 2) Environment and Installs:
- Refer to [README.md](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample#installing)

### 3) Workflow (GitFlow): 
If you are new to [GitFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8&t=194), just think of it as a naming convention for branches. Doing so helps to simultaneously manage the development, release, and maintenance of the repo. 

Video explaining this [Workflow in practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_jAFwofLs) (~5min on 1.5 speed).

<details>
<summary><strong>Branching Conventions</strong></summary>

*Core branches:* `master & develop` (do not commit to or duplicate these)
*Work branches:* `branchtype/your-branch-title` (branchtypes blow)
Master branches
- `develop`
- `hotfix/... `

Develop branches:
 - `feature/... `
 - ` bugfix/... `
-  `release/...`
<br></details>

<details>
<summary>Reasoning:</summary>

- Explicit/extensive workflow yields consistent practice & organized contributions  
- Highly segmented developement lends itself to well organized feature branches
- Not dependant upon the rapid development of continuous integration
</details>

### 4) On using git:
<details>
<summary><i>Git-Beginner (GUI):</i></summary>

If you have no git/gitflow experience and just want to get to work:
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
	- [Setup](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop)
	- The program itself is inherently directive, very easy to pick up.
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
	- [gitflow-intro](https://medium.com/@budioktaviyans/how-to-make-a-git-flow-using-sourcetree-20ab77fe6813)

As a beginner, there is no need to concern yourself with the specifics of GitFlow, just the proper nameing conventions.

<h4>Feature Contribution:</h4>

Join as a contributor or [fork](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample/fork).
```
0) Clone approriate repo and enter directory

1) Open [develop] branch
    $ git checkout develop  
    
2) Create new branch off [develop] (-b)
   Use one branch per feature / fix
    $ git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name

3) Commit changes in relavent chunks as work proceeds 
    $ git commit -am 'short commit description'

4) Share code online
    $ git push origin your-branch-name

5) Submit changes (Performed on GitHub)
  # If Contributor:
    Submit pull request to [develop] branch
	
  # If Forked:
    Submit pull request of [your-branch-name] 
    to original repo at [develop]
```
[NOTE: Commits may occur after pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork). After code review, if changes need to be made, the pull request will automatically update with new commits. If you are to clone a forked directory, make sure you clone to a different directory than where you keep the origional clone.

[GitFlow extensions](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) may provide useful for anything more complex. Primarily in regaurd to more complex branch managment and releases. 
(Extensions currently maintained at: [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh))
