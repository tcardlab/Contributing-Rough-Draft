### 2) Environment and Installs:
- Refer to [README.md](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample#installing)

### 3) Workflow: 
Due to the compartmentalized nature of this program and blah blah blah…..
I have chosen Git-flow over GitHub-flow and utilizing version tags over stable branches for some of the following reasons:  
• explicit/extensive workflow yields consistent practice & organized contributions  
• no real need for continuous integration atm  
• in regard to stable branches, no real need to maintain old versions (doable if needed arises).  
• explicit versioning protocol accountable for a reproducible state
