## Getting Started:
As an open source project we encourage a diverse set of backgrounds. As such, it is anticipated that you may not be familiar with all the recources we utalize. If you require help getting set up, please do not hesitate to ask!

###  1) Accounts:
- *Repository:*  [GitHub](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample)
- *To-do list:*  [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/V94BBx1d/4550ff50fe61eb27b8d304da57b00fe8/optimus-bind) (Click to join)
- *Chat room:*  [Slack](https://bioscienceclub.slack.com/messages/CHK7D10MN/details/) (Upon request)

### 2) Environment and Installs:
- Refer to [README.md](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample#installing)

### 3) Workflow (GitFlow): 
If you are new to GitFlow, just think of it as a naming convention for branches. Doing so helps to organize the development, release, and maintenance of the repo. 

Eplanation...
Extensions currently maintained at: [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

New to GitFlow? These extensions may help: [GitFlow avh cheat sheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

<details>
<summary>Reasoning:</summary>

- Explicit/extensive workflow yields consistent practice & organized contributions  
- Highly segmented developement lends itself to well organized feature branches
- Not dependant upon the rapid development of continuous integration
</details>

### 4) On using git:
<details>
<summary><i>Git-Beginner (GUI):</i></summary>

If you have no git/gitflow experience and just want to get to work:
-   Sourcetree
-   Github Desktop

As a beginner, there is no need to concern yourself with the specifics of GitFlow. 
Just fork/clone, branch, commit, push and pull features with proper nameing conventions.

Fork here:
https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample/fork

<details>
<summary><i>Git-CLI:</i></summary>

If you are new to CLI git, review [here](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html).

Join as a contributor or [fork](https://github.com/tcardlab/optimus_bind_sample/fork).
```
# Clone approriate repo and enter directory
# Open [develop] branch
	$ git checkout develop  
# Create new branch off [develop] (-b)
# Use one branch per feature / fix
	$ git checkout -b [feature, hotfix]/your-branch-name

# Commit changes in relavent chunks as work proceeds 
	$ git commit -am 'short commit description'

# Share code online
	$ git push origin your-branch-name

# Submit changes (Performed on GitHub)
  # If Contributor:
	Submit pull request to [develop] branch
	
  # If Forked:
	Submit pull request of [your-branch-name] 
	to original repo at [develop]
```
[NOTE: Commits may occur after pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork). After code review, if changes need to be made the pull request will automatically update with new commits. If you are to clone a forked directory, mkae sure you clone in  different directory than the origional clone.
